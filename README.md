# Project

## Exploration

### Tasks

[] Distribution of transports per city
[x] Distribution of labels per city
- Distribution of labels per city and per transports (4 x 2 bars plot)
- Distribution of duration avg per city
- Distribution of n_vehicules per city
- Check if nodes between are duplicated between types of transports : no (but can potentially have multi-edges with different types of transports)
- Graph properties
    - Clustering coefficients
    - Degree distribution per city
    - Density
    - Spectrum
    - Centralities
    - etc
- Function to build the graphs


### Attributes
Attributes we keep :

- type of transport
- duration avg
- n_vehicule
- other node features we create : e.g. clustering coefficient, etc.
